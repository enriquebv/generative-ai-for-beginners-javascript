# Getting Started with this course

We are very excited for you to start this course and see what you get inspired to build with Generative AI!

To make your time successful, we have created this page that outlines any setup steps, technical requirements, and how to get help when you need it.

> ⚠️: Codespace & Devcontainer is not available, was prepared for Python and I will only use local setup.

## How to Run locally on your computer using JavaScript

To run the code locally on your computer, you would need to have:

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).
- [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) (to run TypeScript/JavaScript code in Jupyter Notebooks).
- [Jupyter Kernel for Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/jupyter)

And select "Deno" kernel in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Using Visual Studio Code with Python Extension

Probably the best way to use the curriculum is to open it in [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-bethanycheum) with [Deno Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno).

Remember to [activate Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/references/vscode_deno/#deno-enabling-a-workspace).

> **Note**: Once you clone and open the directory in VS Code, it will automatically suggest you to install Deno extensions. You would also have to install miniconda as described above.

### Using Jupyter in the Browser

You can also use Jupyter environment right from the browser on your own computer. Actually, both classical Jupyter and Jupyer Hub provide quite convenient development environment with auto-completion, code highlighting, etc.

To start Jupyter locally, go to the directory of the course, and execute:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

or

```bash
jupyterhub
```

You then can navigate to any of the `.ipynb` files, open them and start working.

## Lessons and Technical Requirements

The course has 6 concept lessons and 6 coding lessons.

For the coding lessons, we are using the Azure OpenAI Service. You will need access to the Azure OpenAI service and an API key to run this code. You can apply to get access by [completing this application](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUOFA5Qk1UWDRBMjg0WFhPMkIzTzhKQ1dWNyQlQCN0PWcu&culture=en-us&country=us).

While you wait for your application to be processed, each coding lesson also includes a `README.md` file where you can view the code and outputs.

## Using the Azure OpenAI Service for the First Time

If this is your first time working with the Azure OpenAI service, please follow this guide on how to [create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal&WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

## Meet Other Learners

We have created channels in our official [AI Community Discord server](https://aka.ms/genai-discord) for meeting other learners. This is a great way to network with other like-minded entrepreneurs, builders, students, and anyone looking to level up in Generative AI.

[![Join discord channel](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/ByRwuEEgH4)](https://aka.ms/genai-discord)

The project team will also be on this Discord server to help any learners.
